# Embedded Etcher
Design files related to a photo-sensitive layering method etching machine
everyone can build to produce prototypes quickly at home or in the lab.

## Architecture
The etching machine consists basically out of two parts. The first part is a UV
light, which is used to develop a photo-sensitive PCB. Once this has been done.
The PCB has to be treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolved in water. This
removes the UV-sensitive plastic, where it has been tackeled by the light. 

The second part is the actual etching machine, which is designed to be
compatible to euro cards (and even bigger ones). The etching machine is either
filled with sodium persulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) or
iron(III) chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) dissolved in water of course.
